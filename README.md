This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Intro

This project is a frontend to my existing one called FightTheBoss, which is a simple on-chain game I have been working on.
Link: [FightTheBoss](https://github.com/AzmuthSzym/FightTheBoss).

The purpose is to have a better way to interact with the game without using the chain explorer.
